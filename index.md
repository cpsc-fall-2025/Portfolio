### CPSC 120 

* Lab 4 part 2

This lab part is one of my favorite labs because it actually turns a simple game into code and you can repeatedly guess whatever the other player was thinking or had put into as their response. The several if and if-else statements were fun to code with and trying to see the different possibilities to see what the possible outcomes that are made between the two players. With taking account of the secret number and the possibilities of what will happen like too low or too high or just straight up winning on the first guess and only needing the if or if-else statements to take account of everything and not much more is what I find fascinating and fun with this lab.


* Lab 7

This lab here only had one part in its entirety which is rare amongst all of the labs however it still had a lot of content to like inside of it like with the different times and how to code all of the different time ranges and the various places that were needed to be accounted for. The reason this is one of my favorite labs is with the fact that you need to think inversely to see when you can park and whether you can park at that specific place when using the not (!) symbol in the code like if it is not at that time and place then the fact is false which means you can’t park there during that place and time. Meanwhile if it is at the correct time and place then the statement is true and you can know currently park at the place you want and using military time is also fun to use so we don’t have to get mixed up coding the AM or PM times and that 24 hour time is what made it fun to code around especially assigning those times to each place for when you are and not able to park at each given place.

* Lab 10 part 2

This lab part is one of my favorite labs because it uses 2D vectors to get all of the states and calculate the density of all of the states seeing which ones are the densest and the sparsest and doing it all in a quite efficient way. It is also interesting we use another file that contains all of the info so that our code and grab and use it so that we are able to to the necessary calculations and with the end result being that it shows the results of the states that we want and see which ones are the most and least populated or in other words, being able to see what are the densest and sparsest states. It is also interesting that we get to use the commands to change the string into an int or double for it to be converted for what we need for the list, also I just find it impressive that we are able to have the code break down such a large task of seeing what are the densest and the sparsest states.
